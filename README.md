## What's SimpleDiscord
Have you ever dreamed of creating a plugin that can do something on your Discord server as well?\
Well from today with this library you can integrate a Discord bot into your plugin and then have it hosted by the server!\
**SimpleDiscord** has many advantages such as being:
### Event-driven lib
You will receive new data through events, which are very easy to listen at
### Auto-sync core
You won't have to update channels, members, or any other component when you receive an event-the library does it itself, so any information is always up-to-date!
### Rate-limit handler
The library performs tight rate limit checks on the various endpoints.\
Although it is always best to await requests, even if you don't our system will manage resources as best it can to avoid reaching the ratelimit via a queue system :D
### Easy to use
We have tried to make the library as dev-friendly as possible - you will quickly understand the logic behind it
